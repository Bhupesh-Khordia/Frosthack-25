# FrostHack - Finance Tracker

## ï¿½ Team: [KamandNET2.0]

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
Welcome to our **Finance Tracker** project for FrostHack! This project is designed to help users manage and query financial data effectively. We utilize **Pathway RAG** to store vector embeddings of financial data extracted from PDFs and retrieve the most relevant document based on user queries. The next steps involve integrating **Fetch.AI** to answer specific queries from these PDFs and developing a **Streamlit web app** for user interaction.

## ðŸš€ Current Progress
We have successfully implemented the **Pathway RAG** system using **LangChain**, which allows us to store financial document embeddings and retrieve the most similar PDF based on a given query.

### ðŸ”œ Next Steps:
1. Integrate **Fetch.AI** to extract answers from retrieved PDFs.
2. Develop a **Streamlit web app** to provide a user-friendly interface.
